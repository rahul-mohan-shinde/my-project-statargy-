Perfect! Since you want to **practice all Spring modules by doing mini projects**, I’ll make a **practical roadmap with around 10–12 mini projects** covering **core Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring REST**. Each project is small but touches important concepts and syntax.

---

## **1️⃣ Core Spring (Beans, DI, IoC, Bean lifecycle)**

**Mini Project 1 – Employee Management (Console App)**

* Concepts: `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Bean`, setter & constructor injection, `@PostConstruct` / `@PreDestroy`
* Task: Create employees, inject services, print details

**Mini Project 2 – Collection Injection**

* Concepts: List, Set, Map injection using annotations and XML (`p:` namespace)
* Task: Maintain a list of departments and employees, print using DI

---

## **2️⃣ Spring MVC (Web + Forms)**

**Mini Project 3 – User Registration Form**

* Concepts: `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, Model, View, form binding
* Task: Create a registration form, validate inputs, show user details

**Mini Project 4 – Product Catalog**

* Concepts: ModelAttribute, form validation, multiple pages
* Task: Display product list, add product, update product

---

## **3️⃣ Spring Boot (REST + Microservice basics)**

**Mini Project 5 – REST API for Employee CRUD**

* Concepts: `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`
* Task: Create REST endpoints for employee management

**Mini Project 6 – Simple ToDo App (REST + H2 Database)**

* Concepts: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, H2 database, `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Service`
* Task: Add, update, delete, list tasks via REST

---

## **4️⃣ Spring Data JPA / Database**

**Mini Project 7 – Library Management**

* Concepts: JPA entities, relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne), repositories, service layer
* Task: Add books, authors, list all books per author

**Mini Project 8 – Student Course Management**

* Concepts: Many-to-Many relationship, Spring Data JPA, query methods
* Task: Assign students to courses, list courses per student

---

## **5️⃣ Spring Security**

**Mini Project 9 – Secure Login App**

* Concepts: Spring Security, Authentication, Authorization, in-memory users
* Task: Login page, restrict access to certain pages

**Mini Project 10 – Role-based Access Control**

* Concepts: Roles (ADMIN, USER), method-level security
* Task: Admin can add/update/delete products, User can only view

---

## **6️⃣ Spring + REST + Frontend (Optional Advanced)**

**Mini Project 11 – Employee Management Web App (Thymeleaf + REST)**

* Concepts: Spring Boot + REST + Thymeleaf templates
* Task: Full CRUD web app using REST API

**Mini Project 12 – Spring Boot + Angular (Optional)**

* Concepts: REST API + Frontend integration
* Task: Frontend calls Spring Boot REST APIs for CRUD

---

### **Summary**

* **Core Spring (DI, IoC)** → 2 projects
* **Spring MVC** → 2 projects
* **Spring Boot + REST** → 2–3 projects
* **Spring Data JPA** → 2 projects
* **Spring Security** → 2 projects
* **Advanced Full Stack (optional)** → 1–2 projects

✅ Total = **10–12 mini projects**

* By practicing these, **all Spring syntax and concepts will be covered**.

---

If you want, I can **make a table showing each project with concepts, required annotations, and what syntax to practice**, so you can follow it **step by step** like a roadmap.

Do you want me to do that?
