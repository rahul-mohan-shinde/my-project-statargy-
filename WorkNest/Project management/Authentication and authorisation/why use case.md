# 🧩 WHY (Use Case) — User Login System

## 🎯 Purpose (Professional Statement)

> The Login System is required to authenticate users, protect system resources, enforce role-based access control, and deliver personalized and secure user experiences.

## 🧩 Detailed Use Cases (Industry Level)

### 1️⃣ User Authentication 🔐

```

---

### 3️⃣ Personalization 🎯

👉 Problem:

Example:

```
User A → Dashboard A
User B → Dashboard B
```
